# Custom Website
I've always felt like I had to make websites a certain way or that I was constrained to doing them in a particular way. \
Although that's sort of true that standards exist, you can also just make a website with HTML and CSS... No one is stopping you (i tell myself) \
I will probably add stuff to it later on (maybe) but for right now I just want to hand make a website like this :)
