## First post

This is my first post! I'm excited for this new page because I finally seemed to manage to figure out a way to make a nice looking website. I was trying and trying forever to find something good, but could never seem to really find a good thing that stuck. If you want to learn about who I am, visit my [about](http://kd0ve.github.io/blog/about) page. I'll go into more detail on who I am and why I'm even making this thing.

Expect a lot of writeups. I will probably make a seperate section for just random notes and stuff, but we will see if that happens.
