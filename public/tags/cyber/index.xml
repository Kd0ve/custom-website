      <description>Intro So, I need to be vaguer about this write-up, but I wanted to put out something regarding a recent competition I did. It was a lot of fun. How I did was significantly better than it had been. I went from getting 717th place to 244th place. So that means I met my goal this year!! Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a quick write-up of one of their sections.</description>
