      <description>This post is going to be about how I would go about setting up a website like mine now that I’ve done it. I’ve learned a lot, and ran into a lot of specific issues, and figured I could be helpful to others who run into these weird little issues too, as it was difficult to find information on them online.&#xA;I’m not going to be going over the specifics of Hugo or really going into detail certain terms I am using.</description>
