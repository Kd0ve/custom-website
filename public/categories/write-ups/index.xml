      <description>Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through how I solved Try Hack Me&amp;rsquo;s Forensics practice challenge. The task is to analyze a memory dump of a target system and find the malicious files. It largely focuses on identifying different IOC.&#xA;Task 1 Getting Started My first instinct is to open up autopsy and pull the image into that program to analyze. Completely incorrect method. Well, not completely. I was able to see the hex dump of the image, but it was listing as two unallocated partitions that showed as deleted.</description>

      <description>Intro So, I need to be vaguer about this write-up, but I wanted to put out something regarding a recent competition I did. It was a lot of fun. How I did was significantly better than it had been. I went from getting 717th place to 244th place. So that means I met my goal this year!! Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a quick write-up of one of their sections.</description>
